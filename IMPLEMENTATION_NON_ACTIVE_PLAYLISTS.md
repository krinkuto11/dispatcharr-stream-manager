# Implementation Summary: Non-Active Playlists Filtering

## Problem Statement
In compliance with the backend/swagger.json (Dispatcharr API specification), recheck the UI and backend of the playlist system. Non-active playlists shouldn't be shown in the UI or at least they shouldn't be selectable.

## Solution
Filter out non-active M3U playlists (where `is_active=False`) at the backend level, preventing them from appearing in the UI entirely.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Endpoint (`backend/web_api.py`)
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/m3u-accounts`

**Change:** Added filtering to remove accounts where `is_active=False`
```python
# Filter out non-active accounts per Dispatcharr API spec
accounts = [acc for acc in accounts if acc.get('is_active', True)]
```

**Behavior:**
- Accounts with `is_active=True` are returned
- Accounts with `is_active=False` are filtered out
- Accounts without the `is_active` field default to active (`True`)
- This filtering happens before the existing "custom" account filtering

### 2. Automated Stream Manager (`backend/automated_stream_manager.py`)
**Method:** `refresh_playlists()`

**Change:** Added filtering to skip non-active accounts during automated playlist refresh
```python
non_custom_accounts = [
    acc for acc in all_accounts
    if acc.get('name', '').lower() != 'custom' and acc.get('is_active', True)
]
```

**Behavior:**
- Only active accounts are refreshed automatically
- Non-active accounts are excluded from the refresh process
- This prevents unnecessary API calls to inactive providers

## Test Coverage

### New Tests Added

#### 1. `test_non_active_playlists_filtering.py` (5 tests)
- `test_filters_non_active_accounts` - Verifies inactive accounts are filtered
- `test_keeps_accounts_without_is_active_field` - Ensures backward compatibility
- `test_filters_non_active_and_custom_accounts` - Tests combined filtering
- `test_keeps_inactive_custom_account_when_custom_streams_exist` - Edge case handling
- `test_all_accounts_inactive` - Edge case: empty result set

#### 2. Updated `test_custom_playlist_exclusion.py` (2 new tests)
- `test_inactive_accounts_excluded_from_refresh` - Automated manager filtering
- `test_inactive_and_custom_accounts_excluded` - Combined filtering in automation

### Test Results
- **26 M3U-related tests:** All pass ✅
- **108 total backend tests:** 107 pass, 1 pre-existing failure (unrelated) ✅

## Impact on UI

### Dashboard.js
- No code changes required
- Non-active accounts are automatically hidden since they're filtered by the backend
- M3U account selection checkboxes only show active accounts

### SetupWizard.js
- No code changes required
- Non-active accounts are automatically hidden from the setup wizard
- M3U account selection switches only show active accounts

## API Specification Compliance

According to `backend/swagger.json`, the M3UAccount model includes:
```yaml
is_active:
  title: Is active
  description: Set to false to deactivate this M3U account
  type: boolean
```

Our implementation correctly honors this field by:
1. Filtering non-active accounts from API responses
2. Skipping non-active accounts during automated operations
3. Defaulting to active when the field is not present (backward compatibility)

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains backward compatibility:
- Accounts without `is_active` field are treated as active (default `True`)
- No database schema changes required
- No breaking changes to API contracts
- Existing functionality preserved

## Security & Best Practices

✅ Minimal code changes  
✅ Comprehensive test coverage  
✅ Consistent filtering logic across components  
✅ Clear documentation  
✅ No breaking changes  
✅ Follows existing code patterns  

## Files Modified

1. `backend/web_api.py` - Added filtering to `/api/m3u-accounts` endpoint
2. `backend/automated_stream_manager.py` - Added filtering to refresh logic

## Files Added

1. `backend/tests/test_non_active_playlists_filtering.py` - New test suite
2. `backend/tests/test_custom_playlist_exclusion.py` - Added 2 tests

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully filters non-active M3U playlists from both the UI and automated processes, in full compliance with the Dispatcharr API specification. The solution is minimal, well-tested, and maintains backward compatibility.
