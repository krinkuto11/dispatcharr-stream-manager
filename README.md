# StreamFlow for Dispatcharr

Automated stream management system for Dispatcharr IPTV services with intelligent quality checking and automatic stream reordering.
1. Updates playlists.
2. Adds Streams to channels via Regex
3. Checks streams
4. Reorders the streams to ensure the best ones are first

## Quick Deployment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krinkuto11/streamflow.git
cd streamflow
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your Dispatcharr instance details
docker compose up -d
```

**Access**: http://localhost:3000

See [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

## Features

- **5 Pipeline Modes**: Choose the automation level that fits your needs (from continuous checking to scheduled-only)
- **Automated M3U Playlist Management**: Refresh playlists every 5 minutes (configurable)
- **Stream Quality Checking**: Analyze streams for bitrate, resolution, FPS, codec quality, and errors
- **Automatic Stream Reordering**: Best quality streams moved to the top
- **Stream Discovery**: Regex patterns for automatic stream-to-channel assignment
- **Global Action**: Manual or scheduled complete update cycles (Update → Match → Check all channels)
- **Web Interface**: React-based UI with unified configuration page and real-time monitoring
- **REST API**: Full API access for all operations

## Architecture

Single Docker container with:
- Flask backend (Python) serving REST API
- React frontend for web interface
- Persistent configuration storage via Docker volumes
- Single port (3000) for all access
- Multi-platform support: linux/amd64, linux/arm64

## Configuration

All configuration stored in JSON files in `/app/data` (Docker volume):
- `automation_config.json` - Automation settings (intervals, features)
- `stream_checker_config.json` - Pipeline mode, scheduling, and stream checking parameters
- `channel_regex_config.json` - Regex patterns for stream assignment
- `channel_updates.json` - Channel update tracking
- `changelog.json` - Activity history

**Web UI**: Navigate to the **Configuration** page (formerly "Automation Settings") to:
- Select your pipeline mode (determines when and how streams are checked)
- Configure scheduled global actions (for pipelines 1.5, 2.5, and 3)
- Adjust update intervals and analysis settings

**Stream Checker**: View real-time statistics, progress, and manually trigger global actions
