# Pull Request Summary: Fix Custom M3U Playlist Issue

## Problem Statement
A "custom" M3U playlist/account was showing up in StreamFlow, suggesting there was a dummy M3U account even though none had been added to Dispatcharr.

## Root Cause
The `get_streams()` function was fetching ALL streams from Dispatcharr, including:
- Streams from M3U accounts (`is_custom=False`)
- User-created custom streams (`is_custom=True`, `m3u_account=None`)

When StreamFlow performed M3U-related operations (playlist refresh, stream discovery), custom streams were included in the results. This made it appear as if there was a "custom" M3U account when streams were grouped or displayed.

## Solution
Added an optional `exclude_custom` parameter to the `get_streams()` function to filter out custom streams when performing M3U-specific operations.

### Key Changes

#### 1. Enhanced `get_streams()` Function (`api_utils.py`)
```python
def get_streams(log_result: bool = True, exclude_custom: bool = False) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
```
- Added `exclude_custom` parameter (default `False` for backward compatibility)
- Filters out streams where `is_custom=True` when enabled
- Updated logging to indicate when custom streams are excluded

#### 2. Updated M3U Operations (`automated_stream_manager.py`)
Updated three operations to exclude custom streams:

**Playlist Refresh:**
- Before: `get_streams(log_result=False)`
- After: `get_streams(log_result=False, exclude_custom=True)`

**Stream Discovery:**
- Before: `get_streams(log_result=False)`
- After: `get_streams(log_result=False, exclude_custom=True)`

#### 3. Comprehensive Test Coverage
- Created `test_custom_stream_filtering.py` with 5 comprehensive tests
- Updated `test_m3u_account_filtering.py` with 1 additional test
- All 13 tests pass successfully

## Impact

### Fixes
✅ No more "custom" M3U playlist appearing in the UI  
✅ Changelog only tracks changes to M3U account streams  
✅ Stream discovery only assigns M3U account streams to channels  

### Maintained Compatibility
✅ Default behavior unchanged (custom streams included by default)  
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality  
✅ Existing code continues to work without modification  

### Code Quality
✅ Minimal changes (~22 lines in production code)  
✅ Surgical modifications focused on the specific issue  
✅ No unrelated code touched  
✅ Comprehensive test coverage (13 tests)  
✅ Well-documented with explanatory comments

## Risks and Considerations

### Low Risk
- ✓ Changes are opt-in (new parameter with safe default)
- ✓ Only affects M3U-specific operations
- ✓ Extensive test coverage protects against regressions

### No Performance Impact
- ✓ Filtering done in-memory (O(n) complexity)
- ✓ No additional API calls
- ✓ Minimal overhead

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise, simply revert the commit. The changes are self-contained and don't affect database schema or external dependencies.
